Multi-Client Private Chat is a C++ multi-threaded chat application using socket programming where:

Multiple clients can connect to a server simultaneously.

Each client sends messages to the server.

Clients never see each otherâ€™s messages.

The server can reply privately to any specific client.

All communication between server and clients is private (except the server itself).

Requirements

POSIX-compliant system (Linux/macOS) or compatible socket support on Windows

Terminal/command-line for running server and clients
